05AB1E is a golfing language. If the name 05AB1E were interpreted as a hexadecimal number and converted to base64, it would result into "Base". I wanted to make a language which has an advantage in base conversion, but now it is more of a general-purpose language. The name 05AB1E can be pronounced in multiple ways, such as 'osabie', 'osable' or even 'usable'.
